<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>I started by rendering a canvas to create the base for my game. Then, I focused on drawing the canvas with all the images that I used for my application such as images for the background the health, coin and poison bar, as well as collectable items as well as
enemies and of course sharkie himself.</p>
