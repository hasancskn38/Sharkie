# Sharkie - A Single Jump-and-Run Game

Help Sharkie overcome his biggest fear, Orcazar, in this exciting Jump-and-Run game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an object-oriented approach.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Object-oriented programming)

## Features

Explore the exciting features of Sharkie:

- **Collecting Items:** Gather coins or avoid poison bottles.
- **Move and Attack:** Swim and attack with Sharkie using your keyboard or on smaller devices, use the buttons.
- **Settings:** Customize your gaming experience - go full screen, check the game settings, or mute the game.

## Game Instructions

Learn how to navigate through the game:

- **Movement:** Use WASD or arrow keys to move Sharkie.
- **Attacks:**
  - Space: Finslap to attack pufferfishes
  - H: Bubble to attack jellyfishes
  - J: Poisoned bubble to attack Orcazar

## The Development Process

I started by rendering a canvas to create the game's foundation. The process involved drawing images for the background, health and inventory bars, collectible items, enemies, and Sharkie. Here's a breakdown of the development steps:

1. **Movement Implementation:** Enabled Sharkie to move in all directions.
2. **Level Design:** Placed enemies and collectibles strategically on the map.
3. **Enemy Spawning:** Implemented random spawning for pufferfishes and fixed spawning for jellyfishes and Orcazar.
4. **Animations:** Animated collectibles, Sharkie, and enemies using image arrays and intervals.
5. **Collision Detection:** Checked for collisions with enemies, items, and map boundaries.
6. **Event Animations:** Introduced animations for hurt and death events for Sharkie and enemies.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into object-oriented programming and game logic. Designing even a simple game highlighted the complexity involved. As a gamer, it deepened my appreciation for the intricacies of game development. Additionally, the OOP concepts learned here proved beneficial when later delving into Angular.

## Potential Improvements

Here are some ideas to enhance the game:

- Add more levels.
- Introduce different difficulty levels.

Feel free to contribute and make Sharkie even more exciting!
